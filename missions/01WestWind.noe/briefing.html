Well, for this day I'm gonna be superman. Everyone knows what's happening on Nogova, the medias are everywhere and special Pentagon with White house lose their minds because of Russians. Who cares about the Nogovian civil war, who cares about Lipsky or rebels? It's always the same everybody fears do something. I barely remind me my last days in Vietnam and remember how we were retreating Saigon, it's only four years ago! And now I was designated to combat operation and hopefully prevent the war

Operation West Wind beginns and you have been chosen for this mission to show our muscles and force the Soviet troops withdraw from Nogova. In this case Moscow will stop supporting the Lipsky's regime and the democracy shall be returned back to this island. To fulfil this objective your task is simple, destroy the Soviet strength - tanks. 
<br><br>
Because the White House is affraid of invasion due to the political reasons, we count on you. If you will sucess, there will be no invasion in need.
<br><br>
Try don't shoot residential zones, we don't want any civilians casulties and at last avoid the areas that are tagged with the exclamation point because of Anti Air Defend.
